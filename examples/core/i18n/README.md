# Internationalization Example

This example shows a very basic Perseus app using internationalization (abbreviated *i18n*) in three languages: English, French, and Spanish. This shows how to use translations, access them, and how to insert variables into them.

Note that this i18n in this example can use either the [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) translator or the lightweight translator, so the `translations/` directory has both `.ftl` files (for Fluent), and `.json` files (for the lightweight translator). The optimized produced bundle sizes are 405.3kb and 289.4kb respectively.
