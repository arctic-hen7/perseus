index-desc = Perseus is a web development framework built entirely in Rust, designed to empower efficient development of the next generation of lightning-fast sites for the modern web. It comes with server-side rendering, static site generation, internationalization, and inferred routing built-in, letting you build even the most complex sites in a breeze.

    .heading = Building a Perseus App:
    .step-1 = Install Perseus:
    .step-2 = Build your awesome app with <a href="https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore" class="underline">Sycamore</a>
    .step-3 = Serve your app locally:
    .step-4 = Deploy your app to a single directory:
    .step-5 = Upload that to a server!

comparisons-table-details =
    .language = The programming language this framework is built in. (Hint: Rust is the fastest!)
    .supports_ssg = Whether or not the framework supports pre-rendering pages at build-time.
    .supports_ssr = Whether or not the framework supports rendering pages dynamically when they're requested.
    .supports_ssr_ssg_same_page = Whether or not the framework supports SSG and SSR (see above) in the very same page.
    .supports_i18n = Whether or not the framework supports building a multilingual app. Some frameworks support this through plugins.
    .supports_incremental = Whether or not the framework supports rendering pages on-demand and then caching them for future use.
    .supports_revalidation = Whether or not the framework supports rebuilding pages that were built at build-time at request-time. Some frameworks can do this by time, or by custom logic. Perseus supports both.
    .inbuilt_cli = Whether or not the framework has a command-line interface for convenient usage. Some frameworks use third-party CLIs.
    .inbuilt_routing = Whether or not the framework supports inbuilt routing. Most frameworks have their own way of doing this if they do support it.
    .supports_shell = Whether or not this framework has an app shell, which makes switching pages much faster and cleaner.
    .supports_deployment = Whether or not this framework supports easy deployment. Perseus can deploy in one command.
    .supports_exporting = Whether or not this framework can operate without a server, as a series of purely static files.
    .homepage_lighthouse_desktop = The Lighthouse score out of 100 for desktop (higher is better). These are collected from Google's PageSpeed Insights tool. These are for the framework's website, and may not reflect the performance of all sites made with the framework.
    .homepage_lighthouse_mobile = The Lighthouse score out of 100 for mobile (higher is better). These are collected from Google's PageSpeed Insights tool. These are for the framework's website, and may not reflect the performance of all sites made with the framework.
