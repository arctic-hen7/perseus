## Features

- `translator-fluent` -- enables internationalization using [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org)
- `hydrate` -- enables Sycamore's *experimental* hydration system (if you experience odd issues, try disabling this)
- `preload-wasm-on-redirect` -- *experimentally* preloads the Wasm bundle for locale redirections (this only partially works right now)
- `idb-freezing` -- enables utilities for freezing your app's state to IndexedDB in the browser (see the book)
- `live-reload` (default) -- enables reloading the browser automatically when you make changes to your app
- `hsr` (default) -- enables *hot state reloading*, which reloads the state of your app right before you made code changes in development, allowing you to pick up where you left off

The remaining features are used internally by the other Perseus packages, and enabling them manually in your project will very likely wreak havoc unless you seriously know what you're doing!

- `tinker-plugins` -- makes tinker plugins be registered
- `server-side` -- enables various functions only used on the server-side (minimizes the client-side bundle)
- `standalone` -- makes Perseus able to be run as a standalone binary by changing some minor internal defaults

## Packages

This is the API documentation for the core `perseus` package, which underlies all Perseus apps. Note that Perseus mostly uses [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US) for
documentation, and this should mostly be used as a secondary reference source. You can also find full usage examples [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples).
