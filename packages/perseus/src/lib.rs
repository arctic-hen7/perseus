/*!
 * Perseus is a blazingly fast frontend web development framework built in Rust with support for major rendering strategies,
 * reactivity without a virtual DOM, and extreme customizability. It wraps the lower-level capabilities of [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore)
 * and provides a NextJS-like API!
 *
 * - ✨ Supports static generation (serving only static resources)
 * - ✨ Supports server-side rendering (serving dynamic resources)
 * - ✨ Supports revalidation after time and/or with custom logic (updating rendered pages)
 * - ✨ Supports incremental regeneration (build on demand)
 * - ✨ Open build matrix (use any rendering strategy with anything else, mostly)
 * - ✨ CLI harness that lets you build apps with ease and confidence
 *
 * This is the documentation for the core Perseus crate, but there's also [a CLI](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/cli.html) and
 * [integrations](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/serving.html) to make serving apps easier!
 *
 * # Resources
 *
 * These docs will help you as a reference, but [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus) should be your first port of call for
 * learning about how to use Perseus and how it works.

 * # Features
 *
 * Perseus performs internationalization using translators, each of which utilizes some translation engine, like [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org).
 * Each of the available translations are feature-gated, and can be enabled with the `translator-[engine-name]` feature. You can set
 * the default translator by setting the `translator-dflt-[engine-name]` (you of course can't have more than one default translator).
 * You can read more about this system [here](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/i18n.html).
