Perseus is a blazingly fast frontend web development framework built in Rust with support for generating page state at build-time, request-time, incrementally, or whatever you'd like! It supports reactivity using [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore), and builds on it to provide a fully-fledged framework for developing modern apps.

-   📕 Supports static generation (serving only static resources)
-   🗼 Supports server-side rendering (serving dynamic resources)
-   🔧 Supports revalidation after time and/or with custom logic (updating rendered pages)
-   🛠️ Supports incremental regeneration (build on demand)
-   🏭 Open build matrix (use any rendering strategy with anything else)
-   🖥️ CLI harness that lets you build apps with ease and confidence
-   🌐 Full i18n support out-of-the-box with [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org)
-   🏎 Lighthouse scores of 100 on desktop and over 95 on mobile
-   ⚡ Support for *hot state reloading* (reload your entire app's state after you make any code changes in development, Perseus is the only framework in the world that can do this, to our knowledge)

## Usage

Here's a taste of Perseus (see [the _tiny_ example](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/comprehensive/tiny) for more):

```rust,ignore
use perseus::{Html, PerseusApp, Template};
use sycamore::view;

#[perseus::main]
pub fn main<G: Html>() -> PerseusApp<G> {
    PerseusApp::new().template(|| {
        Template::new("index").template(|cx, _| {
            view! { cx,
                p { "Hello World!" }
            }
        })
    })
}
```

Check out [the book](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus/en-US/docs) to learn how to turn that into your next app!

## Aim

Support every major rendering strategy and provide developers the ability to efficiently create super-fast apps with Rust and a fantastic developer experience!

## Motivation

There is a sore lack of Rust frameworks for frontend development that support more than just SPAs and client-side rendering, and so Perseus was born. We need something like NextJS for Wasm (but why stop there?).
